## üéØ Project Overview

This repository is part of an exciting group project developed during the Femcoders Norte Bootcamp at Factoria F5. Delisana is an online store specializing in personalized pastries. Our mission is to provide a seamless shopping experience for those who want to enjoy delicious treats without compromising their health.
<br><br>

## Backend Stack

This repository serves as the **backend stack** for Delisana's exciting project. It is intricately linked with our [**frontend repository**](https://github.com/P10MarketplaceDelisana/Delisana_Front), which resides within the P10MarketplaceDelisana organization.<br><br>
Our decision to maintain separate repositories for **frontend** and **backend** offers several key benefits:

1. **Clarity and Separation**: Clear boundaries between project components allow focused work.<br>
2. **Independent Version Control**: Separate versioning and deployment streamline updates.<br>
3. **Reduced Conflicts**: Fewer merge conflicts since teams don't modify the same files.<br>
4. **Security and Access Control**: Role-based access ensures appropriate permissions.<br>
5. **CI/CD Simplicity**: Customized CI/CD flows for each repository.<br><br>

## üåê API Routes

In Delisana, we‚Äôve developed several API routes using Laravel to handle HTTP requests. These routes are essential for communication between the frontend and backend of our application.

**Product Routes:**<br>
/api/products:
Retrieves a list of all available products.<br>
/api/products/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific product by its ID.<br>
**Category Routes:**<br>
/api/categories: Retrieves a list of all product categories.<br>
/api/categories/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific category by its ID.<br>
**Intolerance Routes:**<br>
/api/intolerances: Retrieves a list of all supported intolerances.<br>
/api/intolerances/{id}: Retrieves details of a specific intolerance by its ID.
